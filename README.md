# TableParity

The first goal of this project is to write a program that takes tables from the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) and creates images that show the parity of the values in those tables.

# A279212 
For the original inspiration for this question, see Alec Jones's Math Stack Exchange question [Fractal Pattern from Queen's Move Construction](https://math.stackexchange.com/q/3608917/121988) which asks about this pattern in the parity bitmap of OEIS sequence A279212:
